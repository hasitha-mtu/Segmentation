# Explanation of Key Steps in the Code:
# Data Preparation (load_data_weak_labels):
#
# This is a placeholder for loading your actual drone images.
#
# Crucially, it simulates attaching image-level labels (0 or 1) to each image. This is the weak supervision.
#
# tf.data.Dataset.from_generator is used for flexibility in loading.
#
# Model Architecture (build_weakly_supervised_classifier):
#
# We use a pre-trained MobileNetV2 as an encoder (feature extractor). Pre-training on ImageNet helps leverage general visual features.
#
# A GlobalAveragePooling2D layer collapses the spatial dimensions of the features, and a Dense layer with sigmoid activation predicts the image-level class (river present/absent).
#
# This model is initially trained only with the image-level labels.
#
# Training the Weak Classifier:
#
# The weak_classifier_model is compiled with BinaryCrossentropy loss, suitable for binary image classification.
#
# It's trained for a few epochs using your weakly labeled dataset.
#
# Generating Pseudo-Labels with CAM (get_cam and subsequent logic):
#
# The core weak supervision step. After the classifier is trained, we want to know where in the image the river is, not just if it's there.
#
# Class Activation Mapping (CAM): The conceptual get_cam function (simplified for demonstration) aims to identify regions in the input image that were most influential for the network's positive (river present) classification decision. It often involves computing gradients of the output logit/probability with respect to the last convolutional layer's feature map.
#
# Proxy for CAM: In the provided example, a simplified approach is shown by directly taking the last feature map of the backbone, upsampling it, and thresholding it. A true CAM implementation would involve more precise gradient calculations as described in research papers (e.g., Grad-CAM).
#
# The output of this step is a coarse, pixel-wise binary mask (the "pseudo-label") for each image identified as having a river.
#
# Segmentation Model Architecture (build_segmentation_model):
#
# This is a more standard segmentation architecture, here a simplified U-Net-like decoder built on top of the same MobileNetV2 encoder.
#
# The outputs layer uses Conv2D with sigmoid for the final binary segmentation mask (pixel-wise probabilities).
#
# Iterative Pseudo-Labeling Loop:
#
# Generate Pseudo-Labels: In each iteration, the (currently trained) weak_classifier_model is used to create pseudo-labels for a portion (or all) of the data. Only images where the classifier confidently predicts "river present" are chosen for pseudo-label generation.
#
# Train Segmentation Model: A new tf.data.Dataset is created using these generated pseudo-labels as if they were true ground truth.
#
# The segmentation_model is then trained on this "pseudo-labeled" dataset.
#
# Refinement (Conceptual): In more advanced weak supervision, the trained segmentation_model itself could then generate even better pseudo-labels in the next iteration, creating a self-training loop. This allows the model to progressively refine its understanding from coarse to fine-grained.
#
# Loss Function for Segmentation:
#
# BinaryCrossentropy is used for the segmentation model because each pixel is a binary classification task (river or not river).
#
# MeanIoU (Intersection over Union) is a good metric to monitor for segmentation.
#
# This implementation provides a basic framework. For a real-world application, you would need to:
#
# Implement a robust CAM/Grad-CAM: The get_cam function needs to be a proper implementation to generate meaningful activation maps. Libraries like tf-keras-vis can help with this.
#
# Refine Pseudo-Labeling Strategy: Consider strategies like thresholding pseudo-labels based on confidence, or using techniques like CRF (Conditional Random Fields) or GrabCut to refine the boundaries of the CAM-generated masks before using them as pseudo-labels.
#
# More Sophisticated Segmentation Decoder: A full U-Net with skip connections is generally much more effective for segmentation than the simple upsampling layers shown.
#
# Careful Hyperparameter Tuning: Learning rates, batch sizes, number of epochs for each stage, and pseudo-labeling thresholds are critical.
#
# Validation: Use a small, fully annotated validation set to truly evaluate the performance of your segmentation model throughout the training process, as weak metrics aren't sufficient for final evaluation.
